# Coding Exercises

## Exercise one

Find the matching anagrams and return only the first one from the patching pair. (An anagram is a word or phrase that's formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.)

Ex: ```['code', 'life', 'cdoe', 'lfie']``` -> ```['code', 'life']```

Note: values are case sensitive

## Exercise two

Find the users who were signed in for more than a given span time

Example of data format: 

```data: ["100 3 sign_in"```, ```"100 15 sign_out"]``` 
(```100``` = user_id; ```3, 15``` = timestamps; ```sign_in, sign_out``` = user's actions)

```span: 5``` (```5``` = span time)
